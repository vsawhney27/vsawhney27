## About Me

I'm a student developer passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. From conducting research on generative AI in retail at **Blutag**, to analyzing VC trends in crypto at **VCV Digital**, I've had the opportunity to explore technology through both engineering and business lenses.

Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of computer science through coursework and hands-on projects, and actively contributing to the UWâ€“Madison Data Science Club.
